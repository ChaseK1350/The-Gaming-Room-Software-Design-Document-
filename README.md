# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was the client and they wanted to take their current Android app, Draw It or Lose It, and develop it into a web-based game that can serve multiple platforms. They wanted help streamlining the development of the web-based game. The game needed be developed to allow cross-platform use so that any device can access it. Each game and team name were required to be unique and only one instance of the game is to exist in memory at a time. Each team will be allowed more than one player and the game should allow for one team or more to be playing. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that I did a nice job of discussing the development requirements for developing on different operating platforms. I believe I gave solid insight to the different operating systems and provided good recommendations based on the evaluations of those operating systems. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I really liked the structure the design document provided. It was very straightforward and easy to follow. It allowed me to focus on small details at a time, breaking the project down and allowed me to ensure all requirements were met. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that describing the domain model could use more work. This section took me a bit longer and while I believe it is done correctly, I could have cleaned up the work a bit so it is more readable or easier to understand. In the future I need to make sure I explain the model in good detail, but follow the model the way it is designed so that the reading doesn't feel all over the place. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is so important to understand what the client or user wants. Being able to take the needs/wants of a client or user and translating them into a technical language that allows programmers to really understand what needs to be done is vital to meeting the needs of the client or user. Our goal as programmers is to take those wants or needs and create a product that will fulfill those wants or needs, ensuring our clients and users are happy with our production. Without this translation, it may be difficult to figure out exactly what needs to be done and this will hurt not only the client and users, but ourselves as it wastes time and could cause a loss in clients and/or users. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I did my best to research a lot when designing software. I try to use different documentation and search for different ideas or strategies to find those that are the most efficient. It can be time consuming, but I like taking one section at a time and using methods such as Agile to allow myself to be flexible and adaptive to any changes that may be necessary in any of the sections of the software design. I focus on being detailed in each section so that it is very clear what is needed in each section from a development standpoint.
